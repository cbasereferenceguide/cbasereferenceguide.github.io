Their piggish behavior inspired me to do a C64 only party the following year, which was the start of the LCP series of parties (and eventually I did BFP with precisely these guys + Iopop). ...and I've heard that LCP 98 (in july)<sup>2</sup> inspired them to do Floppy98 later that year (in december).

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p> <ul> <li>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li> <li>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li> <li>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li> </ul> <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p> <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p> <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p> <p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li> <li>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</li> <li>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</li> </ul> <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p> <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p> <p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p> <p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p> <p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p> <p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p> <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p> <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p> <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p> <p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p> <p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p> <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \u201cany later version\u201d, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p> <p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>"},{"location":"about/legal/license/#no-warranty","title":"No warranty","text":"<p>11.

Its creation arose out of necessity rather than foresight, as the system\u2019s hardware limitations \u2014 particularly its lack of bitmap graphics \u2014 required a different approach to character display. With no ability to address individual pixels, the solution was to create a set of 8x8 blocks, each capable of displaying 256 possible patterns.</p> <p>Leonard Tramiel, the creator of PETSCII, recalls the pivotal moment in the design process when Chuck Peddle, a key figure in the development of the PET, made a simple but important request: the character set should include the four suits of cards for a Blackjack game. This seemingly modest request helped shape the character set that would become central to the PET's user interface. Beyond this, the character set needed to accommodate the standard alphabetical characters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Leonard was given complete creative freedom to design all other characters in the set.</p> <p>The design process itself was anything but straightforward. Using graph paper and numerous experiments, Tramiel explored different character arrangements and patterns. The result was the PETSCII character set, which included letters, numbers, punctuation, and a variety of other symbols. However, one notable oversight was the exclusion of lowercase letters. Initially, Chuck Peddle felt they weren\u2019t necessary, but this decision would later be revisited, and lowercase letters were added in subsequent versions of the PET. Had they been considered earlier, Tramiel notes, the character set would likely have been designed differently, with space allocated more efficiently for both uppercase and lowercase letters.</p> <p>An interesting anecdote from this period involves Chuck Peddle introducing Leonard to Robert Heinlein's science fiction novel The Door into Summer. Chuck envisioned a world where nearly everything had a computer in it, much like the futuristic society depicted in Heinlein's book. This vision profoundly influenced the development of the PET, aiming to create an affordable and accessible personal computer that could bring computing to the masses.</p> <p>Despite the absence of lowercase characters in the initial design, PETSCII became a foundational element in the Commodore lineup, including the VIC-20 and the Commodore 64. Its simplicity and adaptability made it ideal for systems without bitmap graphics, and it thrived in this context, proving that practical constraints could lead to innovative solutions.</p> <p>While the team was aware that bitmap graphics were possible, incorporating them into a machine like the PET would have significantly raised its cost. PETSCII\u2019s success, then, was not merely a workaround \u2014 it became a defining feature of early home computing, illustrating how ingenuity in the face of technical limitations can shape an enduring legacy.</p>"},{"location":"petscii/history/#leonard-tramiel","title":"Leonard Tramiel","text":"<p>Leonard Tramiel played a crucial role in shaping the early personal computer and video game industries.
