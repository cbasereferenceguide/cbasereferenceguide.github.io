# MCI Commands
MCI stands for Message Command Interpreter. This may seem like a vague name, but it is actually very descriptive. There are certain commands that the user can place in the messages on the BBS which will not output as normal text. They will instead become interpreted and display the functions that the commands stand for instead.

## There are two types of MCI commands in C*Base
- The @ commands are accessible to sysop levels only.
- The Â£ commands are available to any user who is allowed to use MCI commands in his access group.
