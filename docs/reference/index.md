# Reference

This reference is a working tool for running and configuring C\*Base on the Commodore 64. It collects the details you need to set up, maintain, and extend your board. The material is meant as reference, not as a tutorial, so a basic knowledge of the C64 and its commands is assumed.

Like most reference works, how much you get out of it depends on what you already know. If you are new to C\*Base, some of the information may not make sense until you gain more experience. If you are already familiar with the system, you will find the details you need to make the most of it.

What you will find here is information written in plain English, with the jargon explained where needed. Whether you are new to C\*Base or already know its internals, this section gives you the facts to run your system with confidence.
