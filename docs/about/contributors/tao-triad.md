# Tao / Triad
Taoâ€™s involvement with C\*Base began with curiosity and quickly turned into years of dedicated work. After obtaining a cracked version of C\*Base, Tao identified inefficiencies, removed unnecessary features, and rewrote key sections of code to improve performance.

## From curiosity to custodianship
In addition to fixing critical bugs, Tao created several useful tools, including TBoard-Painter for PETSCII graphics, TAccess-Group Editor for managing access groups, and TSEQ-Viewer, a sequential file viewer.

Through these efforts, Tao became the **legal owner** of C\*Base Systems and played a pivotal role in its development, leaving a lasting impact on the Commodore 64 BBS community.
