# Skyhawk / Triad
Skyhawk's roots are deeply embedded in the BBS scene. He started out as a PC scener with a touch of console influence, pushing his US Robotics Courier modem to its limits in the early ’90s by dialing into both domestic and international boards. As one of the leaders of the Swedish PC wares group [Objectile](https://demozoo.org/groups/80823/) — perhaps best known for being the first to release the Swedish version of Windows 95 — he was a frequent supporter of OCT-affiliated boards such as Immortal Reality, Cloud 9, House of Doom and Virtual Light (unrelated to the TRIAD C64 BBS of the same name).

When Objectile disbanded in the mid-'90s, he joined Rebels PC, continuing to support their boards along with other well-known PC and console systems.

## Journey to planet C64
About a year before OCT dissolved, Skyhawk found himself in the same high school class as [Taper](../taper-triad), who introduced him to the Commodore 64 scene. He first joined Delta before transferring to Ambient when the Swedish members of Delta merged with the Norwegian group Unlight (formerly Digital Designs). He became an active caller on several Swedish C64 boards and a frequent visitor to Taper's BBS, Antidote.

As some Ambient members moved on to TRIAD, Skyhawk remained solo for a while before joining Laxity as a graphician and BBS supporter. As a key figure in the Swedish scene, he was especially vital as a party organizer (Floppy, Big Floppy People), though his activity levels fluctuated over the years. In 2018, he left Laxity and joined TRIAD, breathing new life into his scene activities.

Since then, Skyhawk has focused on BBS culture and creating graphics for the group.

## PETSCII artistry and C\*Base digging
Recognized as one of the top PETSCII artists in the scene, his style blends traditional PETSCII art with influences from the ANSI screens of the IBM PC board culture, resulting in unique, often scrolling and animated artworks. Some of his standout pieces include [Salem’s Lot](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=219279) (first place at Gubbdata 2022), [Kojak](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=244745) (first place at Gubbdata 2024), and the beautifully slow-paced [Watering a Flower](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=249686) PETSCII demo from this year’s Fjalldata (2025).

In addition to his artistic contributions, Skyhawk has become one of the leading C\*Base aficionados in the scene, amassing extensive knowledge across various C\*Base versions and helping others set up new boards. His latest project is this very site, which is shaping up to be the ultimate reference for all things C\*Base.
