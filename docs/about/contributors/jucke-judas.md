# Jucke / Judas

## A Pillar of the Swedish C64 BBS Scene
Jucke has been an influential figure in the Swedish Commodore 64 scene since the late 1980s. It was in 1988 that he acquired the nickname "Jucke," which originated as a playful tease from a friend at a party but soon became his handle on the scene. His extensive contributions span across multiple roles, including trader, phreaker, sysop, PETSCII artist and organizer.

Through the years, Jucke has been associated with several legendary groups, including Genesis Project (G*P), Vision and Judas.

## Revitalizing the Swedish C64 Scene
In the late 1990s, the C64 scene was in decline, with many believing it was on the edge of extinction. However, Jucke played a key role in revitalizing it. His presence at the 1997 Hype demoparty in Malmö was a turning point — where he, along with Skyhawk/Laxity and Taper/Triad, forcibly took over the event’s big screen and displayed C64 demos to the horror of the PC-focused attendees. This moment underscored the contrast between "boring PC nerds" and passionate C64 enthusiasts, showcasing the rebellious nature of a C64 scene refusing to die.

Inspired by these events, the first FLOPPY party was organized in 1998, with Jucke playing a pivotal role. The momentum from this gathering helped revitalising the Swedish C64 scene.

## BBS and Sysop Contributions
Jucke has been an active force in the C64 BBS community. He was co-sysop on Joyride's BBS The Highway, and then also on Antidote, the longest-running C64 BBS, just to mention a few.

Additionally, in recent years, Jucke founded and operates Fria Bad BBS, based in Helsingborg, Sweden. Specializing in PETSCII graphics, Fria Bad has become a go-to spot for C64 enthusiasts and artists.

## PETSCII Art and Music
Jucke is also recognized for his work in PETSCII art, [gracing many C64 boards during the years](../../petscii/index.md) with open screens, end screens and everything in between. Also known for his SID-music DJ sets, he has been playing on numerous parties. For instance, in 2024, Jucke performed a live SID-techno re-edit at Reunion 2024, a demoparty in Kvidinge Folkets Hus. Using an MPC Live loaded with C64 SID sounds, he spent a year preparing for this well received performance.
