# Twoflower / Triad
For those seeking a copy of a vanilla C\*Base originating from Jerry/Triad, the Flood Modded C\*Base version, or the Tronic Modded C\*Base version, this is the place to start. These two versions were discovered while Twoflower was preparing his talk for [Fjälldata 2025](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3469) titled _The Magical World of C64 BBS:es_.

## From BBS to synth stardom: Flood’s unexpected exit
Flood’s BBS, active from 1991 to 1992, was one of the standout boards of its era. Its closure in 1992 came as a surprise, given its popularity at the time. The reason became clear a few months later when Flood appeared on SVT, explaining that he had decided to pursue a music career. He had joined the synth band SPOCK, which was on the verge of gaining widespread recognition.

Among Swedish C\*Base modders, Tronic is widely regarded as one of the most skilled, second only to Tao/Triad. His contributions to [Paradize BBS](https://csdb.dk/bbs/?id=218) in Torslanda — a premier European C64 board — were groundbreaking. Tronic’s Paradize mods showcased his exceptional talent and innovation, setting a new benchmark in the scene.
