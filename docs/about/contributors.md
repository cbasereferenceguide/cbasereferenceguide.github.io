## Larry / Raiders of the lost Empire
My BBS journey began after years of mail swapping when a close friend got his first modem. We started calling PC and Amiga "mailboxes" in Germany, and in 1990/91, I bought a Dataphone S21d (300 baud) from a local enthusiast. This allowed me to call C64 boards, where C\*Base stood out with its PETSCII screens and cursor menus. I decided that if I ever ran a BBS, it would be with C\*Base.

In 1993, I launched my first BBS, **Raveolution**, using a C64, two 1541 drives, and UCBBS. However, crashes and disconnects led me to switch to Cyborg's modded C\*Base 3.1 with a Swiftlink cartridge. By 1996, my setup had evolved to include a CMD-HD, RamLink, C128D, SuperCPU, and a 14.4k modem running Moses' mod. I closed the BBS in 1996 due to military service but briefly reopened in 1997. By then, the BBS scene had dwindled with the rise of the internet, and I shut it down for good.

Two decades later, I revived my C64 setup with modern hardware like the Reloaded MK2 board and Moses' modded C\*Base. Over time, I documented my work, improved components like the Midnight module, and created my own modded version of C\*Base, which I call Larry Mod. Starting from a decompiled Cyborg mod, I rebuilt the system from scratch, blending features from C\*Base and UCBBS. 

I've fixed and improved transfer protocols like X-Modem, Punter, and Y-Modem batch, and even revived the Rainbow protocol, which supports REL files. Currently, I'm working on integrating Z-Modem. My BBS now supports modern hardware like U64, SD2IEC, and Silversurfer and runs on TurboChameleon with a TCP/IP bridge.

Larry Modded C\*Base offers unparalleled hardware and protocol support, packed with features while maintaining stability. For development, I use tools like VSCode, VICE, and custom build scripts.

## Taper / Triad
Taper’s journey into the BBS scene began after purchasing a 2400 bps modem from Jerry/Triad. He quickly became co-sysop of Joyride's BBS, The Highway, which served as the HQ for groups like Brutal, Chromance, Coderz, and Oneway. When Joyride lost interest in the C64 scene and shifted focus to PCs, co-sysops Jucke/Judas and Taper took over managing The Highway, though it remained physically located in Joyride's childhood room in Bjuv. Taper would occasionally ride his moped from Ekeby to Joyride's house, carrying a 1581 in his backpack to back up and exchange wares. Unfortunately, during this period, copying wares often took priority over properly backing up the BBS setup.

Over time, The Highway changed affiliations several times before its hard drive crashed in 1994. By then, it had been the HQ for groups such as Noice, Onslaught, and Oneway. After the board’s closure, Taper and Jucke recognized the need for a new C64 BBS in the 042 area. Taper, who was already experimenting with C\*Base and running a test board for select callers at night, saw the next step clearly. They secured a dedicated phone line, and with Jucke’s PETSCII artistry, Antidote went public in 1994. It quickly became the HQ for TRIAD, Alpha Flight 1970, and Wrath Designs.

Though the exact dates are unclear, Antidote suffered a hard drive corruption in late 1996 or early 1997. Despite restoration efforts using incomplete backups, many posts and graphics were lost. The BBS was later relocated to Ronneby, but suffered a second hard drive crash in 1999. Plans to reopen were halted due to the declining BBS scene and a dwindling caller base. When the Taper returned to the 042 area, Antidote was packed away, seemingly marking the end of its era.

In late 2003, however, Antidote was revived on telnet using a full backup, becoming the first scene BBS running on real hardware to be accessible online. It remains active to this day under TRIAD and Onslaught. Initially operating on a Radar-cracked version of C\*Base, it later transitioned to a Tao-modded version, which evolved as Tao continued his development work. The BBS now runs on a CMD HD with an SCSI-IDE bridge and a CF card for storage, SwiftLink for serial communication, and a SuperCPU.

Taper has forgotten more about C\*Base than most people will ever know — though perhaps not the experts on this site, of course.

## Tao / Triad
Tao’s involvement with C\*Base began with curiosity and quickly turned into years of dedicated work. After obtaining a cracked version of C\*Base, Tao identified inefficiencies, removed unnecessary features, and rewrote key sections of code to improve performance.

In addition to fixing critical bugs, Tao created several useful tools, including TBoard-Painter for PETSCII graphics, TAccess-Group Editor for managing access groups, and TSEQ-Viewer, a sequential file viewer.

Through these efforts, Tao became the legal owner of C\*Base Systems and played a pivotal role in its development, leaving a lasting impact on the Commodore 64 BBS community.

## Twoflower / Triad
For those seeking a copy of a vanilla C\*Base originating from Jerry/Triad, the Flood Modded C\*Base version, or the Tronic Modded C\*Base version, this is the place to start. These two versions were discovered while Twoflower was preparing his talk for Fjälldata 2025 titled _The Magical World of C64 BBS:es_.

Flood’s BBS, active from 1991 to 1992, was one of the standout boards of its era. Its closure in 1992 came as a surprise, given its popularity at the time. The reason became clear a few months later when Flood appeared on SVT, explaining that he had decided to pursue a music career. He had joined the synth band SPOCK, which was on the verge of gaining widespread recognition.

Among Swedish C\*Base modders, Tronic is widely regarded as one of the most skilled, second only to Tao/Triad. His contributions to Paradize BBS in Torslanda — a premier European C64 board — were groundbreaking. Tronic’s Paradize mods showcased his exceptional talent and innovation, setting a new benchmark in the scene.
