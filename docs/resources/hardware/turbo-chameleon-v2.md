# Turbo Chameleon v2

## Stand-Alone Mode: More Than Just a Cartridge  

The **Chameleon** can function independently, without requiring a C64. In this mode, it operates as an FPGA-based computer, similar to the C-One or Minimi, but with more memory, greater FPGA power, and additional interfaces**. It also supports a wider range of cores than the previously mentioned models.  

## Versatile Core Support  

While the primary use case for the Chameleon is **C64 expansion and emulation**, its powerful FPGA and high-speed memory enable additional functionalities:  

- Amiga Emulation (Minimig Core): Runs a fully-featured Minimig core, supporting OCS/ECS Amiga systems with expanded memory and hard disk compatibility.  
- Sinclair Spectrum Emulation: A Spectrum core allows users to run Sinclair Spectrum software seamlessly.  
- VIC-20 Support: Extends the Commodore family by offering VIC-20 compatibility.  
- Atari 800XL Emulation: Atari enthusiasts can run all Atari 800XL software directly on the Chameleon.  

By leveraging these multiple cores, the Chameleon transforms into a highly **versatile** retro-computing powerhouse, catering to fans of various classic platforms.
