# Turbo Chameleon v2

## Stand-alone mode: More than just a cartridge
The Chameleon can function independently, without requiring a C64. In this mode, it operates as an FPGA-based computer, similar to the C-One or Minimi, but with more memory, greater FPGA power, and additional interfaces**. It also supports a wider range of cores than the previously mentioned models.

## Versatile core support
While the primary use case for the Chameleon is **C64 expansion and emulation**, its powerful FPGA and high-speed memory enable additional functionalities:

- Amiga Emulation (Minimig Core): Runs a fully-featured Minimig core, supporting OCS/ECS Amiga systems with expanded memory and hard disk compatibility.
- Sinclair Spectrum Emulation: A Spectrum core allows users to run Sinclair Spectrum software seamlessly.
- VIC-20 Support: Extends the Commodore family by offering VIC-20 compatibility.
- Atari 800XL Emulation: Atari enthusiasts can run all Atari 800XL software directly on the Chameleon.

By leveraging these multiple cores, the Chameleon transforms into a highly **versatile** retro-computing powerhouse, catering to fans of various classic platforms.

## Turbo functionality and RS232 compatibility [^1]
The Chameleon v2 can be used as an affordable replacement for the SuperCPU or other Turbo Cards that work with C\*Base. By adding a Silversurfer RS232 daughter board, it can also function as an SuperCPU/Turbo232 replacement. However, the correct NMI file ("ssurfer") is required.


[^1]: Chameleon v1 cannot run in stand-alone mode with this combination. A pull-up resistor is needed to make the RS232 card work, but this is not an issue when using the Chameleon in cartridge mode.
