# Alien Attack

## Introduction
Alien Attack is a competitive multiplayer game where players pit their aliens against one another in a fight for survival. As your alien wins battles, it earns experience, grows stronger, and climbs the ranks.

## Gameplay
Every new player starts with a standard alien—basic, but battle-ready. You’ll challenge other aliens in turn-based combat. Each win earns you experience points. Once you've collected enough, you gain the right to design your own alien from the ground up.

- Precision
- Strength
- Stamina
- Intelligence

These traits directly affect the outcome of fights, so how you build your alien matters. A maximum of 30 players can join a single session. If the game is full, new players must wait until an alien is defeated. When one dies, its slot becomes available.

## Trivia
Alien Attack was originally developed for C-NET 12.0 by SYN-TECH BBS and later converted for C\*Base 3.1 by Fred.
