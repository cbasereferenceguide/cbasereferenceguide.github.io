# IDE 64 Project

The IDE64 cartridge is a device for connecting a CompactFlash (CF), IDE hard disk drive and/or DVD-ROM drive to a Commodore 64. It is plugged into the Expansion Port. IDE harddrive/CF transfer rate is more than 100 times the rate of the floppy drive 1541. IDE64 expands the features of the original floppy drive and file system presenting the new dimmension of storage for the C64.

The IDE cartridge contains a 512kiB ROM (EPROM or flash EPROM with IDE DOS, Machine Code Monitor, File Manager and Setup), a 28kiB RAM (used for internal buffers), a realtime clock chip (powered by a battery), four LEDs (to indicate the presence of the cartrige and HDD activity), a Short-BUS for new peripherals, Amiga Clock Port, mini USB Device Port (PCLink) and an ispLSI chip.

Current version contains USB PCLink, fast full duplex virtual drive support.
