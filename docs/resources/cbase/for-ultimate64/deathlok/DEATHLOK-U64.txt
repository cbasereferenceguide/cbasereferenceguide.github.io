====================
A. Required Hardware
====================

All you need is an Ultimate64 (U64) and a proper Connection to the Internet via Networkcable or Wireless Fidelity (WiFi).

This Version of C*Base is supposed to be used on an Ultimate64 (U64), never tested it on any other System.

Your ULTIMATE64 (U64) settings:

 -> Set ACIA/SWIFTLINK to $de00 (NMI)
 -> Set Turbo Control to "U64 Turbo Registers"
 -> Cartridge: -NONE-
 -> Set Cartridge Preference to "Auto"

If you don't own something like a CMD HD, don't hesitate to use both 1581's inside your U64. Don't forget to built in JiffyDos ROMS, once for the C64, one for each of the 1581's.

If you're using a 1541, don't forget to insert the "SYSTEM DISK" when "Clock Setting Procedure Screen" appears!

=============
E. My Changes
=============

I really don't want to change this marvelous C*Base Mod, but a few things wouldn't be good for everyday use nowadays I think.

So here we go:

- Make it running on a U64 with up to 38400 Baud just with a Networkcable or WiFi
- Kicked out the unchangeable Password "joshua" for Remote Mode and...
- Choose now your own REM Password with "p" in WAIT-SCREEN (Filename: "p")
- No "Non-Post-Warning" anymore for Guests and Sysop
- Border turns "RED" if someone logs in with REMOTE ACCESS
- No "Advanced to Main (Y/N) for Guests anymore
- No "Leave Msg to Next User (Y/N)" for Guests anymore
- If New User writes "y" for "CRSR Menu on" in Application, it won't get replaced with a useless "-" anymore, but a New User won't become a Cursor-Menu in the beginning before validation, but the New User Menu instead
- If CRSR Menu is on, an additional "Hit a Key" (to make it more readable) after: Info, User Stats, Top Five User, Help, Killer Pic, Hack Attempt Warning, Ranx, Votez, Cardz, Wall, Boardz and Userlist
- If Cursor-Menu is off, at the Main Menu Prompt "RETURN" acts like a "?" from now on
- Additional Transfer-Protocols: "X-Modem 1K" and "X-Modem CRC"
- Now a ":" is allowed in the Boardlist, for "Link:Portnumber"
- Don't laugh, but I had to change the "C/BBS" Filename to "C/B" to complete that cool Style
- Last used Transfer-Protocol will be saved in Userlog



==================
F. Troubleshooting
==================

I've tested this Version of C*BASE several times, but I didn't simulated a real BBS Running over a particular time period with real Users. Just several dozens of intern network calls, so it might be there're a few disagreements left. Or not.

Have fun exploring it!
